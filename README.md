# QOL Scripts

## Move Mouse

I Liked the move mouse application for windows that moves the mouse periodically to keep the computer from going to sleep. I could not find it for Linux so decided to make my self the same program as a simple fish script.

## Set primary monitor

I move around a lot with my laptop and having a quick script to change inputs and close the laptop screen is quite nice.
